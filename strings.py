#Strings
#Are a sequence of characters that are inside single or double quotation marks
a = 'hello'
b = "world"
c = "This is also a string"
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

#When using apostrophes in strings, it's best to use double quotes. That way, there will be no syntax errors
d = "I'm going on a run"
print(d)

#You can print strings either directly in the parameter for the print function, or through inputting a variable
print("Hello, world!")

#You can print strings on different lines using the "\n" escape sequence
print("Hello,\nworld!")

#You can also indent different parts of a string using the "\t" escape sequence
print("Hello,\tworld!")

#You can use the len function to check the length of a string
print(len(c))
